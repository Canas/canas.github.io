                <p>I'm a Machine Learning Engineer working at Landing AI, focusing primarily on the LandingLens platform. Before that I was at Falabella Retail, one of the biggest retails in Latin America, leading one of the first data science initiatives that involded implementing product ranking algorithms into the website. My first years after graduating I worked primarily in academia. I was a researcher for the ALGES Laboratory at Universidad the Chile. During that time I cofounded the university's Machine Learning group and also published a best paper award in DSP 2017.</p>

                    <li><b>Won an internal hackathon</b> in 2020 during my time at Landing AI. We setup an inference server that can automatically label data during as a suggestion to labelers when using our LandingLens tool.</li>
                    <li><b>Won an internal award</b> in 2018 during my time at Falabella due to the outstanding results of our product ranking algorithm. This is not personalization, but rather a smarter way of listing products in categories for the general website user.</li>
                    <li><b>Won a best paper award</b> at the DSP'2017 conference held at Imperial College. Here is the link to the paper. </li>
                    <li><b>Co-founded the official Machine Learning Community at Universidad de Chile</b> in 2016, Beauchef Machine Learning. The group has over 500 members as of today and has served as a hub to promote talks, job offers, and more.</li>
